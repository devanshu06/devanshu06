# Hey, I'm Devanshu Singh 👋  

🚀 **SRE / DevOps Engineer**  
Building systems that are reliable by design, not by luck.

> **Philosophy:** Reliability isn’t added at the end — it’s designed, automated, and owned from day one.

I spend my days:
- automating things that *should’ve been automated already*
- keeping systems alive at 3 AM  
- convincing YAML to behave  

🌍 **I live at the intersection of development, operations, and “why is this failing in prod?”**

⚡ **Fun fact:**  
If it works in staging but not in prod — I *will* find out why.

🚀 Let’s automate, optimize, and scale responsibly.
